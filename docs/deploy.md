# Official deployment runbook

This document operates the official everydashcam.app and beta.everydashcam.app
deployments. It is a maintainer runbook for everydashcam's own
infrastructure, not a recipe for launching another public instance. For a
personal or internal installation, use [the self-hosting guide](self-hosting.md).

## Pages project and build

The `everydashcam` Pages project uses
[Direct Upload](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/direct-upload/).
GitHub Actions builds the site and Wrangler uploads the resulting `dist/`.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Pages project | `everydashcam` |
| Production branch | `release` |
| Preview branch | `main` |
| Build command in Actions | `npm run build` |
| Upload directory | `dist` |
| Node.js version | `.nvmrc` |

Build variables and secrets belong in GitHub Actions. The workflow `env:`
blocks and `.env.example` define the current contract:

- `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` enables opt-in crash reporting in production;
  `VITE_SENTRY_DSN_STAGING` does the same for staging. An absent DSN compiles
  crash reporting out.
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, and `SENTRY_PROJECT` enable production
  source-map upload; staging uses `SENTRY_PROJECT_STAGING`. Upload is bounded
  and non-fatal, and hidden maps are removed before deployment.
- `INDEXNOW_KEY` enables the production ownership file and post-deploy ping.
  Its storage and rotation rules live in [the SEO guide](seo.md#indexnow).

The production Pages alias is `https://everydashcam.pages.dev`. Publishing
uses the workflows below; dashboard build settings do not build this project.

## Deployment pipeline (who does what)

The official deployment is two-tier, with one working branch:

- **`main`** is the only branch anyone commits to. Every push deploys
  staging: `deploy.yml` builds with the staging env and uploads `dist/` as a
  `main` branch deployment, reachable via the branch alias
  `main.everydashcam.pages.dev` - the staging domain (beta.everydashcam.app) is a
  CNAME to that alias (see "Staging domain" below).
- **`release`** is machine-managed: only the `promote` job of `release.yml`
  moves it, fast-forwarding to the commit a `v*` tag points at, so the repo
  records what production runs (it also creates the branch on the first
  promotion). Never commit to or force-push it by hand. The name doubles as
  the Pages project's production branch: the production deploy uploads with
  `--branch=release`, and matching the project's production-branch setting is
  what marks a deployment *production* rather than *preview*.

GitHub Actions owns the whole chain; the Pages project only serves what is
uploaded:

- `ci.yml` - typecheck / lint / unit / e2e on pushes to `main` and PRs.
- `deploy.yml` - staging build + `wrangler pages deploy` on every `main` push.
- `release.yml` (on `v*` tags) - the production build + deploy, the `release`
  promote, the self-host artifacts, and the chained IndexNow ping.
- `indexnow.yml` - the manual re-ping button.

Wrangler deploys to the Direct Upload project by name with
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (custom token, permission "Cloudflare Pages: Edit") +
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - both GH Actions secrets; without them the deploy
jobs self-skip. Build env vars live in the workflow files, not the CF dashboard
- the `env:` blocks of `deploy.yml` and the `deploy` job of `release.yml` are
the current set.

Deployment constraints:

- **Production requires successful CI on the tagged commit.** Wait for CI on
  `main` before tagging. Staging remains independent of CI. Release preflight
  rules live in `scripts/check-release-state.mjs`; a failed preflight publishes
  nothing. If CI is still running, wait for it to pass before retrying the run.
- **The IndexNow ping must run post-deploy**, never as a build step: engines
  fetch the submitted URLs and the key file when they process a ping, so the
  script reads the live sitemap, not `dist/`. It runs as the `ping` job
  chained after `deploy` in release.yml - its failure cannot fail the deploy
  it follows. Secrets: where `INDEXNOW_KEY` lives, why it is in no file, and
  how the ping pre-flights it - `docs/seo.md`, "IndexNow".
- **A fresh deployment propagates non-atomically across the CF edge:** for
  the first ~1-3 minutes a PoP can serve the new HTML while still 404-ing
  its hashed assets, so a load in that window renders a dead shell - for
  ANY online visitor, installed service worker or not: navigation is
  network-first by design (the WHY sits at `NAV_NETWORK_TIMEOUT_MS` in
  `public/sw.js`). The SW only keeps the hole out of its caches (an install
  with a missing asset fails and retries later, so offline launches keep
  the previous build); the IndexNow preflight retries through the same
  window. Do not debug a just-deployed 404 before waiting it out.

## Custom domains

Keep `everydashcam.app` and `www.everydashcam.app` attached to the
`everydashcam` Pages project, with active certificates and proxied CNAMEs to
`everydashcam.pages.dev`. Cloudflare flattens the apex CNAME. The apex serves
the production deployment; `www` redirects to it at the edge.

### Staging domain

After a successful `main` deployment, attach `beta.everydashcam.app` under
Pages -> Custom domains. Once active, set its proxied CNAME target to
`main.everydashcam.pages.dev`. Both the Pages association and the proxied
branch-alias record are required; an unproxied record serves production.
See Cloudflare's [custom branch domain guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/custom-branch-aliases/).

### www -> apex redirect

Use a [Single Redirect](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/settings/)
in the `everydashcam.app` zone:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Match expression | `http.host eq "www.everydashcam.app"` |
| Target URL expression | `concat("https://everydashcam.app", http.request.uri.path)` |
| Status | `301` |
| Preserve query string | Enabled |

Keep `www` proxied and retain its Pages custom-domain association. The rule
preserves every path and query string while changing the hostname to the
canonical apex. Check a nested URL after changing the rule:

```sh
curl -sI "https://www.everydashcam.app/en/cameras/70mai/?ref=test"
# expect: HTTP/2 301
#         location: https://everydashcam.app/en/cameras/70mai/?ref=test
```

## Handling `everydashcam.pages.dev`

Cloudflare hands every project a `pages.dev` subdomain and it cannot be removed.
Options:

### Option A - ignore (default)

Just do not advertise it. The HTML already carries
`<link rel="canonical" href="https://everydashcam.app/">`, so search engines follow
the canonical and do not surface `pages.dev` duplicates.

- **Pro:** nothing to do.
- **Con:** anyone who learns the `everydashcam.pages.dev` URL can open the app there.
  Same content.

### Option B - 301 redirect via a Pages Function

Create `functions/_middleware.js` at the repo root (Cloudflare Pages picks up the
`functions/` folder as middleware/routes automatically):

```js
// functions/_middleware.js
export const onRequest = async ({ request, next }) => {
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    // The production pages.dev URL has exactly one subdomain segment before
    // pages.dev. Preview deploys (for PR/branch) carry a commit-hash prefix -
    // do not redirect those, so they stay reviewable.
    if (url.hostname === "everydashcam.pages.dev") {
        url.hostname = "everydashcam.app";
        return Response.redirect(url.toString(), 301);
    }
    return next();
};
```

- **Pro:** pages.dev visitors land on the custom domain; search engines lose all
  interest in pages.dev.
- **Con:** this adds a production middleware path that must be maintained and
  tested with the rest of the deployment.

### Option C - Cloudflare Access password gate

Pages -> Project settings -> Access -> Configure access policy -> apply to all
preview deployments or to the whole site. You can allow an email list or OTP. Free
for up to 50 users.

- **Pro:** the pages.dev URL becomes private (visible only to invited users).
- **Con:** overkill if you only want it out of public sight; you log in on every
  visit.

## Releases (production deploy + prebuilt self-host artifacts)

A `v*` tag is the single promotion ritual: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
builds and uploads the production site (the `deploy` job - see "Deployment
pipeline"), fast-forwards the `release` branch to the tagged commit, and
publishes one build of `dist/` in
three forms: a versioned zip + a fixed-name `dashcamigo.tar.gz`
(plus `SHA256SUMS`) on a GitHub Release, and a container image at
`ghcr.io/everydashcam/everydashcam` (`latest` + the tag; packaged from the same
already-built `dist/` via `docker/Dockerfile.prebuilt`, not an in-Docker
rebuild). The fixed asset name is load-bearing: the install one-liner in
`docs/self-hosting.md` relies on `releases/latest/download/`. The
artifact build gets no env vars, so crash reporting is compiled out (the
production site build in the `deploy` job carries the production env). The
release notes are generated at tag time from the user-facing changelog.
See `.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md` for release preparation. To cut a release,
tag the `main` commit staging has validated:

```sh
git fetch origin
git tag v2026.07.25 origin/main   # convention: v<yyyy>.<mm>.<dd>[.<n>], zero-padded
git push origin v2026.07.25
```

A manual run of the workflow (workflow_dispatch) builds the same archives as
a run artifact without publishing a release or pushing an image - use it to
dry-run the pipeline.

Portable HTML is built and tested once, then shared by the GitHub Release and
the primary website. Production deployment follows release publication so its
download links and update metadata cannot advertise an unpublished release.
Keep earlier published portable downloads in subsequent deployments; Pages
does not guarantee old asset URLs remain available after a deployment.
See `scripts/retain-portable-downloads.mjs` and
`scripts/smoke-portable-downloads.mjs` for retention and download verification.

The ghcr.io package is created by the first tag run and keeps the visibility it
had then - it is never re-synced with the repo, so check package Settings after
any visibility change or a private repo leaves users with a failing `docker
pull`. The package is account-scoped and outlives the repository: deleting the
repo leaves it orphaned, and a re-created repo's `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push into
that namespace until the package is deleted or granted Actions access to the new
repo. The image push runs *before* the release is published, so this failure
mode costs the whole release, and a `workflow_dispatch` dry-run does not catch
it (it builds without pushing).

### Release integrity

One-time setup, before the first tag: repo Settings -> General -> Releases ->
enable **release immutability**. Published releases then get platform-locked
assets and tags (nothing - including this account - can swap a published zip
or move its tag), plus an auto-generated signed release attestation.
Consequences the workflow is built around:

- Assets lock at publish time, so the workflow attaches them to a draft and
  publishes once. A published release can never be updated: to re-release,
  cut a new tag (`v2026.07.25` -> `v2026.07.25.1`); a re-run on a released tag
  fails on purpose.
- The workflow also attests build provenance
  (`actions/attest-build-provenance`, the assets listed in that step's
  `subject-path` bound to this repo/workflow/commit via Sigstore). User-facing verification
  commands live in `docs/self-hosting.md`. Attestations are free on public
  repos but require Enterprise Cloud on a private one, so the step is gated on
  repo visibility - a private repo publishes a release without provenance
  rather than failing the job.
- Optional defense-in-depth: a tag ruleset on `v*` (Settings -> Rules:
  Restrict deletions + Block force pushes) protects not-yet-released tags;
  note a repo admin can delete the ruleset, so it guards against accidents,
  not a compromised owner - the immutability above is the real lock.

## What the repo ships for deployment

- `vite.config.ts` - the production build (minifiers, vendor splitting, the
  SEO/SW/CSP plugin chain, the `SENTRY_*`-gated source-map handling). Each
  choice is commented at its site in the file.
- `public/_headers` - cache-control + security headers + CSP in enforce mode
  (the current allowlist and its rationale live in the file itself).
- `public/sw.js` - service worker for the offline PWA precache (app shell). Minified
  by a post-build hook (Oxc).
- `public/manifest.webmanifest` - PWA-installable.
- `public/fonts/` - self-hosted woff2 fonts (generated by `node scripts/fetch-fonts.mjs`).
- `.nvmrc` - the Node version used by the GitHub Actions builds.

## What is not needed

- A hand-written `_redirects` - the build already emits `dist/_redirects`
  (legacy `/cameras/` 301s, see `vite-plugins/redirects.ts`), and the app is a
  single page with no client-side routing, so no SPA-fallback entry is needed
  on top. (`_redirects` in CF Pages cannot filter by host - for a
  `pages.dev -> custom domain` redirect use Option B above.)
- Cloudflare Workers outside Pages - it is static assets plus optional middleware,
  there is no backend.
- API keys for core functionality - viewing and export run locally.
  `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` is public, not secret (it is visible in the bundle
  anyway), kept in env only for multi-environment convenience.
