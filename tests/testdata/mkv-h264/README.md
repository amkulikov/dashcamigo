# mkv-h264

Synthetic Matroska clip for the e2e suite, **not** a real recording.

- `clip-h264.mkv` - 3s, 640x360, `testsrc2` pattern, H.264 (Main) video + 48kHz
  stereo AAC audio (1kHz sine), **no GPS**.

The point is the **container**: browsers do not play Matroska through
`<video>.src` (only WebM), so every `.mkv` is forced through the per-file
MSE-remux backend - mediabunny demuxes it, the worker remuxes to fragmented MP4.
H.264 (not HEVC) so the playback + stream-copy export assertions run on CI
Chrome, not only on a macOS box with OS HEVC decode. The AAC track exercises the
"copy the audio out of MKV" path; ADPCM-in-MKV (which mediabunny cannot read)
drops to silent video and needs no fixture. See `tests/e2e/mkv.spec.ts`.
