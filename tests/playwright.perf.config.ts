// Playwright config for the end-to-end performance suite.
//
// Scope: not functional UI testing - measuring real-world ingest pipeline
// timings, memory and CPU on a production preview build. Functional tests
// live in vitest (src/**/*.test.ts) and stay separate.
//
// Hard requirements baked in here:
//  - workers: 1 - parallel test runs share CPU and pollute timings. Perf
//    suites must be sequential to produce reproducible numbers.
//  - full Chromium (not headless-shell) - WebGL (MapLibre) and WebCodecs
//    (transcode worker) need a real GPU/decoder pipeline. The shell variant
//    skips them and produces unrealistic numbers.
//  - launch args - disable background throttling (otherwise headless Chrome
//    throttles timers and decoder priority when not focused, polluting wall
//    times) and enable precise heap info (--enable-precise-memory-info gives
//    byte-level performance.memory readings instead of 10-MB rounded values).
//  - webServer with PERF_TEST=1 - flips vite.config.ts preview headers to
//    enable cross-origin isolation, unlocking measureUserAgentSpecificMemory.
//  - timeout 3 min (default per-test ceiling) - covers light vendors; heavy
//    vendors (BlackVue 436 MB, Juscar 4×340 MB) raise it per-test via
//    test.setTimeout with a vendor-sized budget computed in the specs.
//
// Sample folder discovery happens at runtime in tests/perf/harness/vendors.ts.
// Vendors absent from private/samples/ are skipped, not failed -
// the suite must run anywhere the repo exists, even without the (gitignored)
// sample tree.
