dashcamigo is a browser player and editor for recordings from many dashcam
brands. It has no backend: your files stay on your device while the app joins
clips into trips and keeps cameras in sync. Watch the video alongside the route,
speed and G-force, then trim and save the part you need as an MP4.

## Getting started

- [**dashcamigo.app**](https://dashcamigo.app) — the latest stable release.
- [**beta.dashcamigo.app**](https://beta.dashcamigo.app) — upcoming changes.
- **Install it** — open any version and install it from your browser. After the
  first visit, it can open without a network connection.

## Features

- **Map and charts:** the route is colored by speed. Hover over the route or
  chart to jump to that moment.
- **Events:** harsh braking is detected from the G-force data and marked on the
  chart.
- **Export:** keep the original video quality, or combine cameras and add speed,
  map and G-force overlays. Keep GPS data in the MP4 or save it as GPX.
- **Blur:** mark faces and license plates yourself, or use beta automatic
  detection and tracking. Processing stays on your device.

See [browser support](docs/browser-support.md) for feature limits by browser
and operating system.

## Supported cameras

See [GPS format coverage](docs/gps-format-coverage.md) for cameras tested with
real recordings and formats implemented from open-source references.

Don't see your camera yet? You can help us add it:

- In the app, turn the card's file list into a report you can send us — see
  [dashcamigo.app/add-my-camera](https://dashcamigo.app/add-my-camera).
- On GitHub, open a camera-support issue.
