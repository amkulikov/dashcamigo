//
// Why it does not fit a pure RPC shape: this is a long-lived feed loop with
// push events in both directions. "init" is a one-shot request/reply
// (metadata read → codec mime); after that, control messages from main
// (start-feed, tick, seek, dispose) are fire-and-forget, and data from the
// worker (init-segment, media-segment, feed-done, seek-done, error) is a
// push stream. So:
//   - init                                   → request (await ack)
//   - start-feed, tick, seek, dispose        → main → worker notifications
//   - init-segment, media-segment, ...       → worker → main notifications
//
// Transfer note: init/media segment bytes are sent via the framework's
// ctx.transfer / notify(transfer) - zero-copy ownership move. The
// receiving side gets the ArrayBuffer and must treat it as immutable from
// the sender's perspective.
