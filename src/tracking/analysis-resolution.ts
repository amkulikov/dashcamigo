// Chooses the decode width for a tracking pass. The tracker's crops carry a
// fixed pixel budget (128 template / 256 search - see vittrack.ts), so what
// matters is how many REAL pixels the seed box spans: at the 854 base width a
// plate zone is a ~25x9 px featureless smudge the model cannot hold onto, while
// the source video has 2-4x more pixels on it. Small seeds therefore analyze at
// a higher decode width. Decode itself is native-res regardless (the width only
// scales the sink's output canvas) and inference cost is unchanged (fixed crop
// sizes) - the price is canvas bandwidth, bounded by the cap below and by the
// sink's canvas pool (tracker-worker passes poolSize).
