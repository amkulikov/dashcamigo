// Physical-plausibility guards for the blur auto-tracking pass (identity-switch
// / balloon / frame-exit defense). Pure geometry - no ort import, so unit tests
// run without pulling the inference runtime.
//
// vittrack has a template frozen at init. On a target passing a similar
// distractor (an oncoming car) the confidence peak can jump identity; and the
// size regression has a positive-feedback loop (bigger box -> bigger search crop
// -> bigger box) that balloons the box onto a large nearby object (own bodywork
// on a close pass). A real target cannot teleport across the frame or change
// apparent size by a large factor between two adjacent analyzed frames, so a
// confident-but-implausible step is rejected - kept OUT of rectLast (so the next
// search stays anchored on the target, not the distractor) and reported so the
// caller freezes and counts it toward the loss streak. An uncertain Follow
// holds the last cover through the requested tail and marks it for review.
//
// A per-step rate guard cannot stop a GRADUAL balloon (every step plausible, the
// sum not): that failure is closed by two absolute mechanisms - the seed-derived
// size ceiling (seedSizeCap), and the frame-exit check - an approaching target
// always leaves through a frame edge, and ending the track there removes the
// window where the peak has only bodywork left to lock onto.
//
// The rate guards scale with the time since the last accepted box (dt), so
// they hold whatever the analysis rate is (the pass subsamples inference for
// speed - see tracker-worker's ANALYSIS_FPS). Tunables derived from pass
// geometry (closing speeds, apparent angular rates), not measured from a
// labeled corpus - iterate from real footage.
