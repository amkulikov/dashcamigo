// Face detector (yolov9s-face) on onnxruntime-web. WebGPU-only by product
// decision: this model at 960 input costs ~600 ms/tile on wasm single-thread,
// unusable at pass cadence - machines without a WebGPU adapter do not get the
// faces checkbox at all (gated in the UI; the worker refuses a wasm fallback).
//
// Model: lindevs/yolov9-face 1.0.0 yolov9s-face-lindevs.pt (GPL-3.0 - the
// repo's MIT badge does not survive the GPL-3.0 WongKinYiu base weights it was
// fine-tuned from; license shipped next to the model), re-exported by us:
// ultralytics ONNX at STATIC imgsz=960, then fp16 weight conversion with fp32
// IO and Resize kept fp32 (onnxconverter-common chokes on Resize otherwise).
// sha256 of the shipped fp16 file:
// e3c117a93584f7d3cf595f97df7391c3ad4c4a7e88b8e38149e1b18014e4005d
//
// Why this model and why 960: an exploratory bake-off on 22 real dashcam stills
// (private/research/face-detector-spike/) found substantially fewer obvious
// static false positives than the old 2023 YuNet and more permissive-threshold
// small-face hits at an effective ~960 scale. This was NOT a validation set: it
// has no ground-truth boxes, little scene diversity and originally no night
// coverage. The old "10 verified faces" count was manual review at the raw
// research floor; after the production width + seed gates, only one of those
// stored snapshots can seed a new face track. Treat the model and thresholds as
// provisional until they are measured on labeled dashcam sequences. Known
// residual FP classes include traffic-light lenses, red-man pictograms and
// printed faces; temporal corroboration cannot reject a persistent static FP.
//
// Output decode: ultralytics export, [1, 5, N] channels-first (cx, cy, w, h,
// score) in input pixels, no in-graph NMS - suppressOverlaps handles both
// model duplicates and cross-tile seams.
//
// Runs in a worker. No logging - per-frame hot path.
