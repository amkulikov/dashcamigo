// Combined container-repair DETECTION over moov bytes the indexer already read.
// Both defects we repair (phantom no-data tracks, broken hvcC) live entirely
// inside the moov box, so the indexer worker - which reads moov once per file
// for indexing - can detect them with zero extra IO and hand the main thread a
// ready-to-splice patched moov. This replaces the two separate post-index repair
// stages (repairHvcc + repairPhantomTracks), each of which re-read the moov via
// findMoovInFile on the main thread (1-2 redundant moov reads per file, costly
// on mobile SAF where every slice is a 5-30 ms IPC round-trip).
//
// This module is pure (bytes in, descriptor out) so it runs inside the worker
// and stays unit-testable. The File construction (zero-copy Blob splice) lives
// on the main thread - see src/ui/ingest.ts applyMoovRepair.
