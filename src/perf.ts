// Observability helpers for the ingest/export pipeline:
//  - markStage:     wraps an async stage in performance.mark+measure. Visible
//                   in DevTools Performance tab without setup, consumed by the
//                   perf-test harness via performance.getEntriesByType('measure').
//  - emitLifecycle: dispatches a typed CustomEvent on window for external
//                   observers (perf harness, future integrations).
//
// What this module is NOT:
//  - Not a logger. Stage durations that need to land in bug-report ring
//    buffers go through src/log.ts (see ingest.ts "ingest done" entry).
//  - Not a tracer. No spans, no parent/child links. Use plain marks - the
//    perf harness can correlate by start time.
//  - Not a test-only API. Both APIs are valid observability primitives that
//    any integration could subscribe to.
//
// Hot-path rules (matches CLAUDE.md Logging invariants):
//  - Never call markStage inside a rAF loop, packet loop, GPS-record loop,
//    or timeupdate handler. mark/measure cost microseconds, but called
//    10k times per scenario they pollute the buffer (default cap ~150
//    entries) and add measurable overhead.
//  - Granularity = stage boundary, not per-function-call.

/**
 * Names dispatched via emitLifecycle. Strongly typed so test harness and app

 *  - ingest-done            after ingestFiles finishes (success path only)
 *  - trip-activated         after playFrame attaches a candidate and the player begins loading
 *  - player-first-frame     after the first video frame is actually painted (requestVideoFrameCallback)
 *  - map-tracks-rendered    after the active trip polyline is drawn on the map
 *  - chart-rendered         after the chart strip finishes rebuild for the active trip
