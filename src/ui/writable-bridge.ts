// Main-thread bridge for worker transcode. Instead of passing a FileSystemWritableFileStream to the

// its permission after structured-clone into a worker scope) or a transferable WritableStream (which
// stable Safari cannot postMessage - DataCloneError, WebKit #215485), the main thread keeps the real
// FSA writable and gives the worker one end of a MessageChannel. A MessagePort is transferable on
// every target browser.
//
// Backpressure lives on the worker side (port-writable.ts) via a credit window sized at
// PORT_WRITABLE_HWM chunks in flight before write() blocks - the same depth the old WritableStream
// highWaterMark=16 gave, without a per-chunk round trip. This side just applies each write to the real
// FSA writable in arrival order and acks it.
