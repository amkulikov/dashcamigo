// Slave-position resolution for multi-channel playback. One invariant for
// every camera: a slave tile shows the file+position that matches the wall
// moment the master is showing. Per-channel drift corrections
// (candidate.driftLeadSec, see channel-drift.ts) and per-channel file-length
// asymmetries both fall out of the same arithmetic - there is deliberately no
// special-cased "drift mode", so the boundary machinery is exercised by every
// multi-channel trip, not only by the one camera family with a measured lead.
//
// DOM-free on purpose: player.ts binds the active trip/frame and does the
// <video> work; everything decision-shaped lives here where node-env unit
// tests can reach it.

 * `frameIndex`. The master may itself carry a drift lead (the user can prefer
 * the drifting channel), so positions offset by the difference of leads; the
 * master always plays its own file linearly.
 *
 * The moment may live in the NEIGHBOUR frame's file: a drifting channel's
 * files are cut at different wall instants than their names claim, and even
 * healthy channels' files end a fraction apart. The neighbour is used only
 * when the moment actually lands inside it - frames translate via their
 * nominal wall spacing, so an overlapping protected copy or a recording gap
 * fails the range check and falls back to the own-file clamp/hold. A
 * neighbour must also be native-playable, since the caller swaps <video>.src.
 *
 * Returns null when the slave channel is absent from the frame.
