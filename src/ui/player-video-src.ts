// setVideoSrcFromFile/clearVideoSrc. Keeping them here breaks a would-be
// cycle player <-> zoom.

// attachCandidateToVideo and race protection in the MSE IIFE both rely on
// comparing this marker. Also used by the mini-map and callers to know which
// file is playing without traversing the candidate chain.
//
// videoOwnedBlobUrl: blob URLs we created in setVideoSrcFromFile (native
// path) - revoked on next change or clearVideoSrc. The MSE backend owns its
// URL separately (per-file-mse.ts) and revokes on dispose - not in this map.

 * Single decision: does this candidate need PerFileMseBackend instead of

 * Matroska (.mkv) - none of these containers is natively decodable via
 * <video>.src in Chromium/Firefox/Safari - and for IMA-ADPCM audio (Mio/Navman):
 * there the VIDEO decodes natively but the audio does not, so we route through
 * MSE to decode ADPCM and re-encode it to an MSE-playable codec while
 * stream-copying the video. This is the deliberate "only patched files leave
 * native <video>" contract - a normal MP4 with AAC audio stays on the native
 * path.
 *
 * Used everywhere the player must choose between the two pipelines: attach,
 * preload eligibility, mini-map. Keep all callsites going through this helper.
