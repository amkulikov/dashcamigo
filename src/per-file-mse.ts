// Per-file MSE backend: plays one MP4/TS file through MediaSource on the main
// thread, with all CPU-heavy work (mediabunny demux + fragmented MP4 mux +
// feed loop) offloaded to a dedicated Web Worker (workers/per-file-mse-worker.ts).
//
// Why a worker:
//   Profiling cold-start TS attach on a 350 MB Juscar file showed ~100% main
//   thread busy in mediabunny operations (readSection 49%, addEncodedVideoPacket
//   18%, our feedVideo 15%, markNextPacket 15%) for 5+ seconds. With main
//   thread saturated, MediaSource.sourceopen / SourceBuffer.updateend events
//   sit in the event-loop queue and do not dispatch, which manifests as 4-10
//   sec playback start latency on TS and hev1 HEVC files. MP4 native pipeline
//   does not hit this because the browser demuxes off the main thread in
//   native code; we only hit it when our own JS-based pipeline is required.
//
// Scope of this backend: HEVC sample entry hev1 (mediabunny remuxes to hvc1),
// MPEG-TS/Matroska containers, and otherwise-native MP4/MOV whose ADPCM audio
// must be decoded and re-encoded. Ordinary ISOBMFF goes straight to <video>.
//
// Main side responsibilities:
//   - Lifecycle of WorkerClient, MediaSource, SourceBuffer.
//   - appendBuffer ordering through a local queue (SB.updating blocks direct
//     calls; ordering across the queue preserves moof/mdat sequence).
//   - Sliding-window trim and QuotaExceededError aggressive trim+retry.
//   - Periodic "tick" notification so the worker can drive backpressure
//     without touching the <video> element.
//
// Architecturally simpler than the removed src/seamless.ts (per-trip MSE):
// scope = ONE FILE. One worker -> one MediaSource -> one SourceBuffer.
// At file end: worker emits feed-done, we call endOfStream.
