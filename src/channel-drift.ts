// Per-session channel drift correction for cameras whose muxer cuts files by
// frame count and names them by nominal schedule (70mai): when one sensor
// delivers slightly fewer frames per wall second than the stamped rate, its
// files stay perfectly-shaped (exactly N frames, uniform PTS, nominal name)
// while their CONTENT slides ahead of the name - about a second per hour,
// several seconds of front/rear desync by the end of a long drive.
//
// The lead is measurable without decoding: all channels stop at the same wall
// instant when recording ends, so the leading channel's tail file is shorter
// than the front's by exactly the lead accumulated over the session. That
// delta is distributed linearly across the session (the sensor-rate deficit is
// constant) and stored per candidate as `driftLeadSec`; consumers shift the
// file that much later on the content axis when fetching this channel's
// content. The correction never rewrites startUtc - frame grouping, the trip
// timeline, GPS and overlays all stay on the nominal (front-honest) axis.
//
// Every guard falls back to "no correction" (null lead), so a camera without
// the defect - or a session too damaged to measure - behaves exactly as before.
