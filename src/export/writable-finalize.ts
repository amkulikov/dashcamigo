// Shared finalize helper for the export-to-disk path. The last step of every
// export (stream-copy and re-encode) is closing the FSA writable, which commits
// the file to disk (native FSA) or finishes a streaming download (ponyfill).
//
// On some browsers this close has been observed to hang indefinitely, leaving
// the UI stuck at "Finalizing..." with no error (the close promise simply never
// resolves). A hang with no signal is the worst diagnostic outcome - the ring
// buffer shows the export started and nothing after. This helper turns an
// infinite hang into (a) a breadcrumb pair (close start / close done with the
// elapsed time) and (b) a hard timeout that rejects with a clear error so the
// flow surfaces it and cleans up, instead of waiting forever.

// Backstop only. The close is a flush of the OS write-back cache to the target
// media + an atomic temp->final rename. The bytes are handed to the OS during
// the encode loop, but on slow removable media (an SD card / USB flash stick -
// the dashcam's own storage, a common export target) the write-back trails far
// behind and close()'s final fsync must wait for gigabytes to reach the medium.
// That legitimately takes minutes, so a flat timeout kills a slow-but-working
// export (worst case: the detached close later succeeds, leaving a complete file
// on disk while the user was told it failed). Scale the deadline by the bytes
// written at a pessimistic floor throughput, with an absolute floor for small
// clips. If close has not resolved by then the writer is truly wedged.
// Exported for the unit test only - keeps the test's deadline math derived
// from the real constants instead of hand-copied literals.

// Class 2 SD card / a cheap USB2 flash stick under fsync. Lower = more generous
// deadline = less chance of aborting a slow-but-progressing close. At 2 MiB/s a
// 20 GB clip gets a ~2.8 h backstop; a genuine wedge still eventually errors.

/**
 * Closes `writable`, racing it against a watchdog timeout. Logs a breadcrumb

 * report can tell "moov written, close hung" apart from "encode never finished".
 *
 * On timeout it rejects with an Error (the underlying close keeps running
 * detached - it cannot be cancelled - but its later settle is swallowed so it
 * does not surface as an unhandled rejection). `label` identifies the call site
 * in logs (e.g. "stream-copy" / "transcode-bridge"). `bytesWritten` sizes the
 * watchdog deadline (see MIN_FLUSH_BYTES_PER_MS); 0/omitted falls back to the
 * absolute floor.
