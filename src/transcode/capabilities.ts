// as High profile (its buildVideoCodecString hardcodes profile 0x64; only the
// LEVEL is derived, from resolution + bitrate) and gates on a single
// VideoEncoder.isConfigSupported with the hardwareAcceleration we pass. On a
// machine with no hardware H.264 encoder and only a Constrained-Baseline software
// one (e.g. Chrome's bundled OpenH264 on a GPU-less Linux box), that High-profile
// config is unsupported and the encode throws mid-export. This probe lets the
// export UI detect that up front and keep the user on stream-copy instead of
// failing with a raw codec error.

 * (Linux open-source builds): AAC is a proprietary codec it omits, yet it still
 * bundles libopus, so Opus encode works where AAC does not. Returns null when
 * NEITHER encodes (no audio encoder at all) - the caller drops audio + notifies.
 *
 * Trade-off the caller must surface: Opus-in-MP4 plays in browsers and VLC but
 * NOT in QuickTime / Apple's native players / older Windows, so an Opus fallback
 * is "audio present, but less compatible" - the export flow shows a soft notice.
 *
 * Probes the exact 48 kHz / stereo / 128 kbps config the encode source asks for

 * encoder request). Never throws - a probe failure degrades to the next

 *
 * Constraint this leans on: mediabunny's source rejects a mid-track INPUT format
 * change (the guard runs before the transform resampler), so every sample fed -
 * real audio AND emitSilence gaps - must share one source format. Callers
 * guarantee that (export-flow drops audio for mixed-format ranges; silence is
 * emitted at the probed source format, not the 48k/2 target). See feedSegmentAudio.
