// Inferred (synthetic) event segments derived from speed and bearing.
//
// Stand-alone from events.ts (which produces discrete TripEvent markers from
// G-spikes). Where TripEvent is a point in time, InferredSegment is a [start, end]
// range - used to render colored bars under the chart timeline.
//
// Prior incidents documented in events.ts:
//  - turn by accumulated dbearing was previously tried as a discrete marker
//    and removed (winding roads produce constant noise). Re-added here as a
//    segment because the noise is bounded by sustained-duration thresholds
//    and the visual format (bar, not marker) is more forgiving of false positives.
//  - stop was previously dismissed as "visible on the chart as flat zero,
//    marker added no UX value". Re-added because bars index multiple signals
//    on one strip - the value comes from quick visual scanning across all
//    four tracks, not from any single one.
//
// Detection is intentionally conservative: thresholds favor missing real
// events over flagging spurious ones. Each segment also carries an intensity
// in [0..1] (peak physical magnitude divided by a "very strong" cap) so the
// strip renderer can render mild events dimmer than hard ones and an
// occasional false positive does not dominate the visual.
//
// Pure module - no DOM, no state. Tested in inferred-events.test.ts.
//
// All thresholds are SI in the record's native units (m/s, deg) - independent
// of the user's display preference.
