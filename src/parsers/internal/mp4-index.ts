// Mp4Index - single pass over the moov section of a file, results shared by
// all plugins during classifyByContent and parseVideoEmbeddedGps. Eliminates
// repeated re-reads of the header (previously each plugin called loadHeader
// independently, and buildMp4Index itself read 16 MB up front).
//
// Adaptive header reads: by default we only load the moov box (typically
// 100 KB - 2 MB) plus the bytes of structural top-level boxes we recognise
// (free, gps0, IDIT). The 16 MB "probe window" used by `hasFreeGpsMarker` /
// `hasLigoGpsMarker` and the streaming free-GPS scan is loaded ON DEMAND
// when the caller asks via the `probeBytes` option. For most files
// (BlackVue X-series, GPMF, Navitel tail, PNDM, NMEA-sbtl, RVMI, Carcam
// LigoGPS-meta) the marker probe is never needed - their GPS lives either
// in moov (track/atom) or in a known structural offset. Saves 14-16 MB of
// IO per such file - dominant cost on mobile SD/UFS.
//
// Contents:
//   - moov box + its DataView (always);
//   - parsed tracks with handler-type and sample-format (gpmd / sbtl / text /
//     meta - foundation for GPMF/PNDM/Thinkware/LigoGPS);
//   - top-level free box (BlackVue X-series), loaded only when present;
//   - top-level/nested `gps ` atom inside moov (Novatek structural path);
//   - presence flags for "freeGPS " and "LIGOGPSINFO" literals - populated
//     ONLY after probeMarkers() is called; undefined means "not probed".
//   - lazy first-sample cache for sbtl/text/meta tracks.
//   - first few freeGPS hit offsets - seeds for predicted-offset jump scan.
//   - ALL top-level udta atoms + payload heads (Kenwood / LigoJSON / GKU
//     carriers), last-top-level-box-end (Kenwood CCCC-trailer probe anchor),
//     and the frea/'ver ' KodakVersion (Rexing affine-deobfuscation gate).
//
// Lifecycle: one Mp4Index per file, built once by the dispatcher via
// buildMp4Index(file, opts), then passed to plugins. probeMarkers() can be
// called after construction when the dispatcher decides marker scans are
// worthwhile (typically for Novatek family files where streaming scan may
// be needed).
