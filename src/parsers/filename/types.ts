// Filename/path metadata extraction techniques.
//
// Each "process" (time / channel / mode / sequence) is a flat library of
// techniques. A technique has a stable id (so diagnostics can report which
// regex actually matched) and an extract function that returns the value or
// null. The pipeline walks each list and the first non-null wins.
//
// A new camera typically reuses existing techniques. When it does not, only
// the missing technique is added to the relevant list - we never grow files
// by vendor count, we grow by unique extraction variants.

 *             R=rear, B=back, I=interior), a path/folder with a spelled-out name
 *             (Tesla front/back/cabin, FITCAMX Movie/Movie_E), or a
 *             single-channel model (only one camera, nothing to confuse).
 *   - false - an index letter whose letter->mount mapping is a pure vendor
 *             convention we cannot verify (CarCam A/B/C/D, Vantrue A/B/C where
 *             B is the cabin). The mount is still our best guess and is used for
 *             grid layout / grouping, but the UI shows a positional "Channel N"
 *             label instead of "Rear camera" to avoid asserting a mount we are
 *             only guessing.
