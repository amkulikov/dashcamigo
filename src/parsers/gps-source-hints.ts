 * - "embedded": GPS lives inside the MP4/MOV/TS container. Always probe.
 * - "log-sidecar": GPS is in a text log with mp4Filename inside (70mai CSV).
 *   If the log was parsed, records exist by now; if not, embedded won't help.
 * - "basename-sidecar": GPS is in a same-basename file (GPX, .map, .gps).
 *   Sidecar handlers run in parallel; same logic - probing the container is
 *   pointless.
 * - "none": format is known to carry no embedded GPS in our current corpus
 *   (Tesla SEI not parsed, E-Ace XOR not decoded, FitCamX TS has no data
 *   stream). Switch entry to "embedded" when a working extractor lands.
 * - "unknown": no hint matched. The pipeline treats this as "may have
